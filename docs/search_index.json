Means people have more propensity to churn, more values closer to 1 than 0 in our population, and \\(\\beta\\) is the inaction parameter (pushes the peak of the beta distribution to thel eft of the graph), meeans more values closer to 0 thatn 1, means a low propensity to churn. Compare \\(alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) to 1, where either is high if it is greater than 1. If both \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) = 1, results in uniform. 1.3 shapes of beta distribution #define range p = seq(0, 1, length=100) #create plot of Beta distribution with shape parameters 2 and 10 plot(p, dbeta(p, 5, 5), type=&#39;l&#39;, ylab = &#39;density&#39;, col = &#39;purple&#39;, main = &quot;Beta Distribution&quot;) lines(p, dbeta(p,1,1), col = &#39;red&#39;) lines(p, dbeta(p,0.5,0.5), col = &#39;blue&#39;) legend(.7, 4, c(&#39;Beta(5,5)&#39;,&#39;Beta(1,1)&#39;,&#39;Beta(0.5,0.5)&#39;), lty=c(1,1,1),col=c(&#39;purple&#39;, &#39;red&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;)) #define range p = seq(0, 1, length=100) #create plot of Beta distribution with shape parameters 2 and 10 plot(p, dbeta(p, 1.5,0.5), type=&#39;l&#39;, ylab = &#39;density&#39;, col = &#39;purple&#39;, main = &quot;Beta Distribution&quot;) lines(p, dbeta(p,0.5,1.5), col = &#39;red&#39;) lines(p, dbeta(p,2,4), col = &#39;blue&#39;) legend(.7, 4, c(&#39;Beta(1.5,0.5)&#39;,&#39;Beta(0.5,1.5)&#39;,&#39;Beta(2,4)&#39;), lty=c(1,1,1),col=c(&#39;purple&#39;, &#39;red&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;)) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
